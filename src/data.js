      "Found in households and industries, this includes dirty water, organic liquids, wash water, waste detergents and even rainwater. This can be classified into point source(manufactured liquid waste) and non-point source(natural liquid) waste. When non-hazardous liquid waste is involved, it’s relatively easy to dispose of it. A method called dewatering is often used to make it easy to dispose of this waste. The way it works is that the waste is placed into something like a large bag. The water is then removed so only the solid waste is left behind. After this the solid waste is disposed in a landfill",

      "Solid waste can be found in household, commercial and industrial locations.

      "Organic waste is another common household. All food waste, garden waste, manure and rotten meat are classified as organic waste. Over time, organic waste is turned into manure by microorganisms. However, this does not mean that you can dispose them anywhere. Organic waste in landfills causes the production of methane, so it must never be simply discarded with general waste. They need to be disposed off in green bins/garden bags.",

    title: "Recyclable Waste",
    content:
      "Recyclable waste includes all waste items that can be converted into products that can be used again. Solid items such as paper, metals, furniture and organic waste can all be recycled. Instead of throwing these items in with regular waste, which then ends up in landfills, place them in your yellow recycling bin. If you’re unsure whether an item is recyclable or not, look at the packaging or the diagrams on the lid of your yellow recycling bin. Most products will explicitly state whether they are recyclable or not.",
